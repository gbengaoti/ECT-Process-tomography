'fvmV2' is the file to run to compute phi for all electrodes,
however, it depends on precomputed distances AllDistance,
which we get by running 'fvm-for-precomputing-distance'.
They both depend on the triangulation function available 
from Matlab 2015 and above.
'fvm-for-precomputing-distance' also depends on the function 'getDistance'. 
The data needed to run this program are 'mesh.mat' and 'AllDistance.mat'.
